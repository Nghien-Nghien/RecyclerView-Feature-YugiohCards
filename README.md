# YugiohCards
I'm fan of the game Yugioh! - Joey the Passion.
So, I created a pet project about cards in game. When launch app, you can open 2 activities are Yugi Cards & Joey Cards (this is updating). And in Yugi Cards will have some of items are cards. When you click on item, it will show a image dialog has the content is that photocard.
